Even then, some of a CNN‚Äôs best qualities, like translation invariance, are so powerful (especially for certain tasks) that some Transformers incorporate convolutions in their architecture. <a href="model_doc/convnext">ConvNeXt</a> flipped this exchange around and incorporated design choices from Transformers to modernize a CNN. For example, ConvNeXt uses non-overlapping sliding windows to patchify an image and a larger kernel to increase its global receptive field.

ViT capitalized on the Transformers‚Äô efficient architecture to demonstrate competitive results with the CNNs at the time while requiring fewer resources to train.

Since the Swin Transformer can produce hierarchical feature maps, it is a good candidate for dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection.
